# second-test-project
have done in same time like first, but more afwul then first. Dont try implement or repeat = )  only for learning  process  
Ofc thera many mistakes and java code conventions not used in this test. Why ? because in that moment i was  full of convictions that this 
agreement are not useful and only stopped development process, but today i change my opinions and i rewrite this tests in more right way. So 
dont blame me please -__-
